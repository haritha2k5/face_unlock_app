Update `main.py` to reference the correct image:

```python
known_img = cv2.imread("known_faces/your_image.jpg")
```

Make sure only one face is visible in the image.

## üß™ How It Works

* The app accesses your webcam to display a live feed.
* Clicking **Unlock** captures a frame and sends it to the backend.
* The backend detects a face and compares it to the known one.
* If similarity exceeds the threshold, access is granted.
